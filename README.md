# MySQL-Full-Stack-Burger-App
Eat-Da-Burger is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat, and watch them be consumed without the lift of a finger.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
* Each burger in the waiting area also has a Eat Me! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
* Your app will store every burger in a database, whether eaten or not.

Check out this video of the app for a run-through of how it works.

### Prerequisites
#### In order to utilize the Burger App, install the required npm packages into your terminal by inserting the following:
* npm i express
* npm i express-handlebars
* npm i body-parser
* npm i mysql
